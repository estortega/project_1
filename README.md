# Wildfire Data Analysis Proposal
# Project Overview

Wildfires are natural disasters that can cause devastating impacts on the environment, economy, and human lives. This project aims to analyze wildfire data to identify trends, correlations, and insights that can help improve wildfire management and response strategies.

# Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- Geographic Patterns of Wildfire Occurrences
- Map wildfire incidents using latitude and longitude data.
- Identify high-risk zones based on historical wildfire occurrences.
- Monthly Variation of Fire Incidents
- Analyze the number of fire incidents per month.
- Determine peak wildfire seasons.
- Optimal Firefighter Deployment
- Assess the ideal number of firefighters required relative to fire size.
- Injury and Fatality Trends Over Time
- Examine the correlation between injuries, fatalities, and wildfire severity.
- Analyze whether improved fire management has reduced casualties over time.
- Resource Allocation per Wildfire
- Calculate the average number of personnel, air tankers, and other firefighting resources used per wildfire.
- Assess whether resource allocation has improved wildfire control effectiveness.

# Methodology

- Data Collection & Cleaning
  Extract relevant data from wildfire incident reports and geospatial sources.
  Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Use statistical methods and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.
  Generate heatmaps, time-series plots, and bar charts for insights.

- Geospatial Analysis
  Utilize GIS tools to map wildfire locations and identify risk-prone areas.

# Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,)
Google Docs (for presentation)

# Expected Outcomes

- Identification of key geographic wildfire hotspots.
- Improved understanding of wildfire seasonality.
- Insights into firefighter deployment efficiency.
- Better understanding of fire-related injuries and fatalities over time.
