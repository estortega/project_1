# Wildfire Data Analysis Proposal

1739333844902

Project Overview

Wildfires are natural disasters that can cause devastating impacts on the environment, economy, and human lives. This project aims to analyze wildfire data to identify trends, correlations, and insights that can help improve wildfire management and response strategies.

Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

Geographic Patterns of Wildfire Occurrences
Map wildfire incidents using latitude and longitude data.
Identify high-risk zones based on historical wildfire occurrences.
Monthly Variation of Fire Incidents
Analyze the number of fire incidents per month.
Determine peak wildfire seasons.
Optimal Firefighter Deployment
Assess the ideal number of firefighters required relative to fire size.
Injury and Fatality Trends Over Time
Examine the correlation between injuries, fatalities, and wildfire severity.
Analyze whether improved fire management has reduced casualties over time.
Resource Allocation per Wildfire
Calculate the average number of personnel, air tankers, and other firefighting resources used per wildfire.
Assess whether resource allocation has improved wildfire control effectiveness.

Methodology

Data Collection & Cleaning Extract relevant data from wildfire incident reports and geospatial sources. Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Use statistical methods and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends. Generate heatmaps, time-series plots, and bar charts for insights.
Geospatial Analysis Utilize GIS tools to map wildfire locations and identify risk-prone areas.
Exploratory Analysis, Findings, Patterns, Corelations And hypothesis Testing

We have provided visualizations which include:

* What are the geographic patterns of wildfire occurrences (latitude/longitude mapping)?

{Nia add your graphs here or send it to me and I will add it}
* How does the number of fire incidents vary by month?

1739337604251
1739337615229
* What is the ideal firefighter-to-acre ratio for effective wildfire suppression

1739337513922
1739337532935
* How the injuries and the deaths correlate overtime ? and try to answer if the fires severity is the reason for it to be high or perhaps we have gotten better at stopping fires

1739337167868
1739337180658
* How many personnel, air tankers, and other firefighting resources are used on average per wildfire?

Expected Outcomes

Identification of key geographic wildfire hotspots.
Improved understanding of wildfire seasonality.
Insights into firefighter deployment efficiency.
Better understanding of fire-related injuries and fatalities over time.
